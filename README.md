# Autotube
Elevate your YouTube channel with our Python app! Input a video topic, and watch as it crafts a script using ChatGPT's API. It then generates related image prompts, creates visuals via Ideogram.ai, animates them into 3-second clips, and integrates everything into Movavi video editor, automatically adding and resizing your logo.

WARNING & DISCLAIMER FOR AUTOMATION SCRIPT USAGE
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE AUTOMATION SCRIPT.

General Warning: This automation script is provided "AS IS", without any guarantees or warranty of any kind. By using this script, you acknowledge that it has the potential to perform actions automatically and without direct user intervention. These actions, if misconfigured or used improperly, could result in unintended consequences, including but not limited to data loss, system disruptions, and breaches of terms and conditions on various websites.

No Liability: The author of this script takes no responsibility for any damages, losses, or liabilities that may arise from the use or misuse of this tool. It is your responsibility to understand and assess the risks associated with using this script in your specific context.

Automation Fragility: Automation scripts, especially those relying on mouse coordinates and image recognition, are inherently fragile. This is due to several reasons:

Dependence on Interface: If the interface of a software or website changes, even slightly, the script may fail or, worse, perform unintended actions.
Environment Differences: Variations in screen resolution, color profiles, OS interfaces, or other software can affect the script's operation.
Image Recognition Limitations: Minor changes in visuals or the appearance of elements can lead to recognition failures.
Potential for Harmful Actions: This script has the potential to perform harmful actions, such as deleting files or altering settings, especially if the aforementioned fragility results in the script misinterpreting its environment or instructions. Always monitor the script, especially when using it for the first time or in a new environment.

Compliance with Terms & Conditions: It is your responsibility to ensure that the use of this script complies with the terms and conditions of any website or software it interacts with. Many platforms prohibit the use of automation tools and may take actions, including banning or legal actions, against violators.

User's Responsibility: By using this script, you agree to use it at your own risk. It is advisable to always have backups of any critical data and to test the script in a safe environment before deploying it in a live or critical context.

By continuing to use this automation script, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms and conditions outlined above. If you do not agree with these terms, do not use this script.

Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive automation script that integrates various utilities and modules to perform tasks such as ideogram automation, browser interactions, animations, downloads, and video editing.

Setup Instructions
1. Virtual Machine Recommendation:
For safety and security, it is highly recommended to run this script within a virtual machine. This adds an additional layer of protection, preventing potential unintended changes or damages to your main system.

2. Browser Requirement:
This script is designed to work specifically with the Microsoft Edge Browser. Ensure you have it installed and set as the default browser on your system.

3. Dependencies:
Ensure you have all the necessary modules installed. You can typically install these using pip:

4. File Paths:
Sound Files:
Two sound files are loaded during the execution:
"sounds/meseeks_can_do.mp3"
"sounds/pickle_rick.mp3"
Ensure these sound files are present in the sounds/ directory or update the paths in main.py accordingly.
Important: You must edit the file paths in the script to reflect the location of the files on your system. This is crucial for the correct functioning of the automation.

5. Running the Script:
To run the automation, simply execute the main.py script. This will initialize all required modules and utilities and start the automation process.

Customization:
The script is modular, allowing for customization and integration of additional features. If you wish to extend or modify the functionality, refer to the respective utility modules.

Notes:
Ensure that you monitor the automation, especially during the first run or after significant system updates. Automation scripts, while powerful, can be sensitive to changes in the environment.
